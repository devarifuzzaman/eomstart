# ðŸ“˜ Project Documentation: eomstart

## Overview

**eomstart** is a web application project developed by [devarifuzzaman](https://github.com/devarifuzzaman). The repository is structured to separate the client and server components, indicating a full-stack application architecture. The primary technologies used are JavaScript, CSS, and SCSS.

## Repository Structure

```
eomstart/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/         # Frontend application source code
â”œâ”€â”€ server/         # Backend application source code
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitattributes  # Git configuration attributes
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore      # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
```

### 1. `client/`

* Houses the frontend source code of the application.
* Predominantly written in JavaScript, with styling in CSS and SCSS.
* Represents approximately 90.2% of the codebase in JavaScript, 5.8% in CSS, and 4.0% in SCSS.

### 2. `server/`

* Contains the backend source code.
* While specific details are not provided, the use of JavaScript suggests a Node.js environment.

### 3. `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`

* `.gitattributes`: Configures Git attributes for the repository.
* `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories for Git to ignore, such as `node_modules/`, build directories, and environment files.

## Development and Deployment

* **Frontend**: Likely built using modern JavaScript frameworks or libraries, given the structure and language usage.
* **Backend**: Presumably developed with Node.js, possibly using frameworks like Express.js.
* **Styling**: Utilizes both CSS and SCSS for styling components.
